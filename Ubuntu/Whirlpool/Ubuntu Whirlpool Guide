Welcome to the Whirlpool Installation Guide

The Raspbian Guide mostly works,however there are some commands that need to be changed.
In this guide the only commands listed will be the ones that need to be changed.
so follow the Raspbian guide and just modify the commands listed on this guide.


Source: https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/Whirlpool


Instead of sudo adduser -m toruser
Use adduser toruser

Instead of

sudo usermod -aG toruser
Use usermod -aG sudo toruser

If you try to install TOR with the raspbian's guide instructions you will run
into dependency errors,so

Instead of


deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org stretch main
deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org stretch main

Add the following to /etc/apt/sources.list

deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org bionic main
deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org bionic main


that is basically the only changes you need to make.

Thank you for following the guide!
